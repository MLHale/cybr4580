This is a template document for pitches. Please make sure your pitch has all of these components. **Your pitch should not be longer than 1 page**

## Title
Provide a reasonable recommended title. 

## Problem
What are the most salient aspects of the problem space? What have others done to address the problem? 

## Opportunity 
What can still be done (e.g. in the scope of a capstone project)? This isn't a full proposal, but provide enough detail for me to understand what you are thinking. What kinds of research outcomes could come out of this idea?

## Value Proposition
Why will your contributions matter? How will it help people?

## A Picture is worth a thousand words
Give me a visual aid that helps explain your idea - it can be anything that is useful to your discussion (maybe an initial high level diagram).
