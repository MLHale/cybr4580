# CYBR4580 Pitch format
This is a template document for pitches. Please make sure your pitch has all of these components. **Your pitch should not be longer than 1 page**

## Title
Provide a reasonable recommended title. What would you call your project?

## Problem
Define the problem you are trying to solve. Why is it a problem? What are the issues? Who/what does it affect? What existing solutions have others developed to address the problem? Where/why do those solutions fall short? 

## Opportunity / Scope
What can be done in the scope of a semester? This isn't a full proposal. Try to be succinct while providing enough detail for others to understand what you are thinking. Be reasonable about what you can achieve in a semester with 5 people. 

## Value Proposition
Why will your contributions matter? Is it ethical or can it be conducted ethically? How will it help people? How will it make the world safer or better? 

## A Picture is worth a thousand words
Create a visual aid that helps explain your idea - it can be anything that is useful to your discussion, e.g. a high-level diagram like a flow chart or architecture diagram.
