# CYBR4580 Final Project Milestone (Milestone 3): Final Delivery Increment, Packaging, and Release


## Overview
This project milestone tasks you with producing your final major deliverable. Since every project is different the requirements stated below are as stated as generally as possible.

- [Project realization Progress Report](#project-realization-progress-report) - Clearly document your efforts towards achieving the project methodology since last milestone (Milestone 2).
  - Identify tasks achieved from your backlog
  - Document the product increments (an agile term for the things you produce) generated in this milestone
  - Bind tasks, code artifacts, and documentation together
- [Final Report: Packaging and Release](#packaging-and-release) - Package all of your product deliverables, results, and outcomes for release
  - The Final report should be non-trivial and list out all accomplishments across the project, pulling together the plan from milestone 1 and the deliverables achieved in Milestones 2 and 3.
  - The Final report should be delivered as-if you were preparing it for release to your customer. This means including sufficient supporting documentation to understand and fully interpret your results, install needed tooling, etc.
- [Presentation](#presentation) - Present your project to the class, your external partner (where applicable), and others in Cybersecurity

## Project realization Progress report
Here, you should identify the tasks you have achieved in milestone 3, document the product or other intellectual/applied outcomes that have resulted from your efforts, and bind your tasks to the outcomes and documentation you have produced so far.

Be productive, work towards completing your process, and document what you do.

Documentation towards project realization will come in the form a project report. Your project report should be placed on GitHub in the same repository you used for Milestones 1 and 2. Create a new markdown file called `milestone-3.md` that contains the following.

```markdown
# Progress Report (insert date here)
## Overview
(insert brief overview of efforts made)

## Outcomes
(brief overview of outcomes - what did you achieve?)

also list them out like this:
* outcome 1
* outcome 2

## Hinderances
(insert brief discussion of challenges encountered)


```

### Submission materials
For this submission, you should submit your progress report as a `.md` file in your project GitHub repository

#### Grading Criteria
Your team will be graded as follows:

| | Meets expectations (33-40) | Some Issues (25-32) | Does not meet expectations (0-24)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Effort and progress | It is clear that the team has made non-trivial effort and progress towards project realization.| There is some evidence of effort and progress, but more could have been done in the time. | Little effort or progress was made.|
| Documentation | Code artifacts and tasks are documented well. Documentation is clear and illustrative. | Some code is documented, but large portions are not. | Little or no documentation.|

**Total 80 points.**


## Final Report: Packaging and Release
An important part of developing or assessing a product is making the product or results accessible to those that might want to use it or them. This part of the final milestone tasks you with preparing your product, code, processes, and/or other relevant results for release by using relevant deployment strategies and by creating appropriate companion documentation. It is expected that every team will create a final report for release and review by partnering companies and organizations. All projects with code or other requirements must prepare a list of installation instructions and run instructions necessary to install and run any required apps. All projects examining existent systems must prepare a list of steps to reproduce their analysis.

### Code artifact Expectations
 * Polish your product by squashing as many bugs as possible and cleaning up the user interface.
 * Package your code and/or deployment environment for release using relevant deployment solutions such as [github](https://github.com/), [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/creating-node-modules), [bower](https://bower.io/docs/creating-packages/), [apt-get](https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA), [Python pip](https://packaging.python.org/distributing/), etc. The simplest deployment solution is creating a GitHub repository that is cloneable and has a few short install instructions. Other solutions like docker can be helpful in situations where the deployment environment context is complex or depends on certain versions of supporting software. Others like npm, bower, apt-get, or pip are useful for libraries that others might want to install or add to their own projects.
 * Create ```installation``` and ```getting started``` instructions using markdown in their repository or documentation to detail what an end-user must do to setup their app or product.

### Results and findings Expectations
 * Summarize your results discovered over the life of the project.
 * Summarize findings as they relate to the original proposal in milestone 1. What worked, what didn't work? Where would future work be most useful?
 * The report should arrange documentation generated over the project timeline in a logical way that supports the summary. Think of the final report as a compilation of all of your work over the semester. 
 
A suggested format for the final report is as follows:

```markdown
# Project name
## Executive Summary
(overview of project, reuse from milestone 1, update if scope changed)

## Project Goals
(high level project goals, reuse from milestone 1, update if scope changed)

## Project Methodology
(specific methodology followed in the project, reuse from milestone 1/2, update if scope changed)

## Results / Findings
(brief overview of outcomes - what did you achieve?, list milestone 1/2/3 outcomes, make an effort to logically collect and organize the findings)

(bulleted lists can also be helpful to structure your results discussion)
* outcome 1
* outcome 2

## Install Instructions (if applicable)
### Requirements
(list of any software / hardware requirements necessary to run the code/app/etc)

### Installation Instructions
(list of steps to install the product/app/code/etc)

### Getting started
(list of any steps to run the code after installation and/or manage the apps over their lifecycle)


```

### Submission materials
For this submission, you should submit your final report as a `.md` file called `finalreport.md` or `README.md` (to make it your default page) in your project GitHub repository. You should also convert the md file to pdf and upload it as `finalreport.pdf` for use on other non-web-based file stores. 

### Grading Criteria

| | Meets expectations (33-40) | Some Issues (25-32) | Does not meet expectations (0-24)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Polish and effort | Team has made clear and sufficient effort commensurate with project scope over the life of the capstone project. Findings  demonstrates polish and significant effort. | Some bugs / user interface oddities / inconsistency of results are present, but overall some polish is evident. | The results/product/app are incomplete, inconsistent, and/or not ready for release. Limited or no effort is evident in the findings. |
| Packaging and Deployment | The results/product/app/etc is packaged and ready to be shipped to the customer as appropriate (i.e. results are documented well, products/apps are in a deployable / packaged state. | Some effort has been made to package results / code / resources / etc, but the packaging/deployment isn't fully successful making it difficult for the consumer to use the results of the project. | Little to no effort has been made to package the results/product/code for release and it is unusable by the customer. |
| Documentation Accuracy | Documentation is consistent and accurate. Assumptions are stated appropriately and/or getting started/installation instructions work as stated without issue. Findings are replicable given the available documentation in the report. | Some documentation is missing or incorrect. | Many documentation artifacts are missing or inaccurate.|
| Activity and Findings Completeness | Findings from project activities have been summarized at a high level and are presented in a format that is easy to read and understand (e.g. tabular). Diagrams and visual aids are used effectively where needed. Findings demonstrate sufficient work product given the scope of the project. | Findings are missing from the summary or are difficult to read and understand as presented. | Little or no efforts were made to summarize findings and results are very difficult to read and understand. Results are insufficient for length and scope of capstone. |
| Final Report Structure |The team prepares an overall report from existing documentation generated during the project. The report includes the assessment and finding summaries and connects the findings to existing documentation in the project repository. The final report is comprehensive. | Some report items are missing, or the report does not link to all activities and findings. | Little effort has been made to compile results of semester-long activities and results.|

## Presentation
You will be expected to present your Final Milestone to the class via a recorded videa. The video will be due on the day of our official final (published on the UNO website). The video may be watched by external guests - so please address an audience beyond just the instructor. Videos should be no longer than 30 minutes.

Your presentation should cover:
 * High level goals, initial scope, and adjustment to scope (keep it succinct)
 * Project methodology followed over the project
 * Principle Project findings and outcomes
 * Demos of any relevant tooling / code / attacks / etc that resulted from the work and/or findings
 
### Submission Materials
Submit your slides on canvas as part of your overall submission and upload your video via vidgred. Also upload your presentation materials to your github repo.

### Grading Criteria
Presentations will be graded using the following rubric. Each student on a team is expected to contribute to and help deliver the presentation.

Students fail to answer some questions with appropriate detail. | Large gaps in knowledge are evident. Students fail to answer most questions or fail to provide sufficient detail. |
| Graphics (10pts) | Graphics are used effectively to explain and reinforce screen text as appropriate. | A few graphics are used, but some areas of the presentation are missing graphics when they could be key to better understanding. | Few or no graphics are used. Team relies too much on text in slides. |
| Professional (10pts) | Slides have few or no misspellings, grammatical errors, or unprofessional content. No inappropriate memes or things of this nature are present. | A few misspellings, grammatical errors, or unprofessional items are included in the content. | Large reliance on inappropriate memes, multiple misspellings or grammatical errors are evident. |
| flow (10pts) | Team maintains good presentational flow between team members. | Team refers to some notes or a few hand-off pauses exist, but it does not interrupt the flow of discussion | Team must constantly refer to notes or there are long pauses that demonstrate poor practicing. |
<!--| Eye contact and flow (10pts) | Team maintains eye contact with the audience, seldom or never returning to notes, and maintains good presentational flow between team members. | Team refers to some notes or a few hand-off pauses exist, but it does not interrupt the flow of discussion | Team must constantly refer to notes or there are long pauses that demonstrate poor practicing. |-->

* Note that Demos may include videos if the conditions necessary to replicate the demo cannot be re-created in a live in-class demo.
